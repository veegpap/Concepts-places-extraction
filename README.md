# Concepts-places-extraction


The application was developed to explore spatial concept extraction from unstructured text. It was built using shiny and R.

The app is up and running at this link : https://veegee.shinyapps.io/new_txt_app_2/ 

The extraction process was tested on 11 articles from various internet sources and 26 subsections from the first chapter of the book "World Regional Geography, People, Places and Globalization" avilable here https://open.lib.umn.edu/worldgeography/#main .

The annotation process was carried out using the Stanford CoreNLP 4.2.0 jar files through the CRAN package coreNLP.
