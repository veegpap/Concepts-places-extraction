The movement of tectonic plates is another aspect of the earth’s dynamics that affects human activity. The earth’s
crust, which is between 10 and 125 miles thick, is not one big solid chunk but rather a series of plates that cover a
molten iron core at the center of the planet. The plates that cover the earth’s surface slowly shift and move. Plates
can slide away from each other or they can collide, and they can slide parallel to each other in opposite directions.
When two plates collide and one plate slides under an adjacent plate, the process is called subduction. Movement
or shift where two plates meet can cause earthquakes and is usually associated with volcanic activity.

Mountain chains, such as the Himalayas, are a direct result of two plates colliding. The collision pushes up the
earth into a mountain chain, either by direct pressure or by volcanic activity. Plates can move up to an inch a year
in active regions. Driven by the earth’s internal heat, these plates have created the planet’s mountain landscapes.
Earthquakes and volcanic action along plate boundaries (called faults) continue to affect human activity and
can cause serious economic damage to a community. Plate boundaries can be found near many natural edges
of continents. The continuous action of the plates causes serious earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that can
devastate human activities. Earthquakes near the sea often trigger tsunamis that can create enormous waves that
bring destruction to coastal regions in their path. The earthquake off the east coast of Japan in 2011 created a
tsunami that brought additional destruction to nuclear energy facilities, exposing parts of Japan and the rest of the
world to radiation.
