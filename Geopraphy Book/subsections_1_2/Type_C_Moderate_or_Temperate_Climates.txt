Often described as moderate in temperature and precipitation, type C climates are the most favorable to human
habitation in that they host the largest human population densities on the planet. Type C climates are found mostly
in the midlatitudes bordering the tropics. Seasonal changes are pronounced, with a distinct winters and summers.
Winters are cool to cold and summers are usually warm. Precipitation varies from low to high, depending on
location. In the United States, C climates dominate the southeast and the West Coast.

Type C climates are not the most widespread on the planet, but they have attracted the largest human populations.
One reason for the attraction has been the abundance of forests, farmland, and fresh water found in type C regions.
The main population centers of the planet are in type C climates. With over seven billion people on the planet and
growing, humans have populated most of the regions with type C climates and are now filling up the other areas
that have A, B, or D climate types.
