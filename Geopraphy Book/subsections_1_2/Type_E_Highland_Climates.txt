Type E is an extreme climate type found in the polar regions near or to the north of the Arctic Circle and near or
to the south of the Antarctic Circle. Regions with type E climates are cold with permanent ice or permafrost year round.
Vegetation is minimal, and there are no trees. Temperatures may warm slightly during the short summer
months but rarely rise above 50 degrees.
