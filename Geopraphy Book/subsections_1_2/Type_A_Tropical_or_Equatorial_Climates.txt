The humid tropical type A climate, usually found in the tropics, has warm temperatures year round with a high
level of precipitation, typically in the form of rain. Type A climates have various subgroups that indicate how
variably the rainfall is distributed throughout the year. Some type A climates produce a dry season and a wet
season (monsoon), while others receive consistent rainfall throughout the year.
