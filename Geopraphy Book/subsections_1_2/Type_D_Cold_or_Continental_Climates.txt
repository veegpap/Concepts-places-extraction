Type D climate regions are often found in the interiors of continents away from the moderating influence of large
bodies of water. They are often farther north than type C regions, resulting in colder winters. Seasonal variations
exist, with cool to hot summers and cold winters. Precipitation is usually in the form of rain in summer and snow
in winter. Regions with type D climates can be found in the Great Lakes region of the United States, much of
Canada, and a large portion of Russia.
