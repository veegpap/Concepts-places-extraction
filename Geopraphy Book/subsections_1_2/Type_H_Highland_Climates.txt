Type H highland climates are usually listed as a subcategory of type E climates. Mountain ranges can create a
variety of climate types because of the change in elevation from the base of the range to the summit. Different
climate types can be found on the same mountain at different elevations. Type H climates designate highlands
or mountain terrain. Variations in climate exist on most mountain ranges. Climates at the base of mountains will
vary depending on whether the mountains are found in the tropics or in the higher latitudes. For example, high
mountains near the equator may have a type A climate at their base and a type E climate at their summit with
various type C and type D climates between them. Type H climates are found where elevation differences are
profound enough to provide different climate zones. Higher elevation relief can reach above the tree line and have
permanent snow cover at the summit. The term relief is used in geography to indicate elevations of a land surface.
Elevation zones with permanent ice or snow can resemble a type E polar climate.
