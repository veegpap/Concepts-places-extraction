A country’s demographic statistics can be illustrated graphically by a population pyramid. A population pyramid
is essentially two bar graphs that depict male and female age cohorts either in absolute size or as a percentage of
the total population. Male cohorts are typically shown on the left side of the pyramid, and females are on the right
side.

The shape of a country’s population pyramid tells a story about the history of its population growth. For example,
a high-growth-rate country has a pyramid that is narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, showing that every
year more children have been born than the year before. As family size decreases and women in a society have
fewer children, the shape of the pyramid changes. A population pyramid for a postindustrialized country that has
negative growth would be narrower at the bottom than in the middle, indicating that there are fewer children than
middle-aged people. Four basic shapes indicate the general trends in population growth:

Rapidly expanding
Expanding
Stationary
Contracting

These shapes also illustrate the percentage of a population under the age of fifteen or over the age of sixty-five,
which are standard indicators of population growth. Many postindustrial countries have a negative population
growth rate. Their population pyramids are narrow at the bottom, indicating an urbanized population with small
family sizes.
