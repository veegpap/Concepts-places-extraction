As countries move from an agricultural to an industrial economy, there is a major shift in population from rural to
urban settings. The Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century ushered in major technological developments
and changes in labor practices, which encouraged migration from the farm to the city. Because of increased
mechanization, fewer farm workers are needed to produce larger agricultural yields. At the same time, factories
in urban areas have a great need for industrial workers. This shift continued into the information age of the late
twentieth century and continues in many parts of the developing world in the current century.

A basic principle of population growth that addresses this rural-to-urban shift states that as countries industrialize
and urbanize, family size typically decreases and incomes traditionally increase. Though this may not be true in
all cases, it is a general principle that is consistent across cultural lines. Agricultural regions generally have a
larger average family size than that of their city counterparts. Fertility rate is the average number of children a
woman in a particular country has in her lifetime, whether or not they all live to adulthood. If a fertility rate for
a given country is less than 2.1—the replacement level—the population of that country is in decline, unless there
is significant immigration. A fertility rate greater than 2.1 indicates that the country’s population is increasing.
Some children will never reach reproductive age nor have children of their own, so the replacement rate has to be
slightly greater than 2. The concept of fertility rate is slightly different from the term family size, which indicates
the number of living children raised by a parent or parents in the same household. In this textbook, family size is
used to illustrate the concept of population growth and decline.
