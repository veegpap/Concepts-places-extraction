The term culture is often difficult to differentiate from the term ethnicity. In this textbook, ethnicity indicates
traits people are born with, including genetic backgrounds, physical features, or birthplaces. People have little
choice in matters of ethnicity. The term culture indicates what people learn after they are born, including language,
religion, and customs or traditions. Individuals can change matters of culture by individual choice after they are
born. These two terms help us identify human patterns and understand a countryâ€™s driving forces.

The terms culture and ethnicity might also be confused in the issue of ethnic cleansing, which refers to the forced
removal of a people from their homeland by a stronger force of a different people. Ethnic cleansing might truly
indicate two distinct ethnic groups: one driving the other out of their homeland and taking it over. On the other
hand, ethnic cleansing might also be technically cultural cleansing if both the aggressor and the group driven
out are of the same ethnic stock but hold different cultural values, such as religion or language. The term ethnic
cleansing has been used to describe either case.
