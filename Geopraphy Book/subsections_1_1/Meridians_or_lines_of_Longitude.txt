The prime meridian sits at 0 degrees longitude and divides the earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.
The prime meridian is defined as an imaginary line that runs through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich,
England, a suburb of London. The Eastern Hemisphere includes the continents of Europe, Asia, and Australia,
while the Western Hemisphere includes North and South America. All meridians (lines of longitude) east of the
prime meridian (0 and 180) are numbered from 1 to 180 degrees east (E); the lines west of the prime meridian (0
and 180) are numbered from 1 to 180 degrees west (W). The 0 and 180 lines do not have a letter attached to them.
The meridian at 180 degrees is called the International Date Line. The International Date Line (180 degrees
longitude) is opposite the prime meridian and indicates the start of each day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.). Each day
officially starts at 12:01 a.m., at the International Date Line. Do not confuse the International Date Line with the
prime meridian (0 longitude). The actual International Date Line does not follow the 180-degree meridian exactly.
A number of alterations have been made to the International Date Line to accommodate political agreements to
include an island or country on one side of the line or another.
