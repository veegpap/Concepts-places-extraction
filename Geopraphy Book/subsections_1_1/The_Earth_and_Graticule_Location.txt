When identifying a region or location on the earth, the first step is to understand its relative and absolute locations.
Relative location is the location on the earth’s surface with reference to other places, taking into consideration
features such as transportation access or terrain. Relative location helps one compare the advantages of one 
location with those of another. Absolute location, on the other hand, refers to an exact point on the earth’s surface
without regard to how that point is related to any other place. Absolute location is vital to the cartographic process
and to human activities that require an agreed-upon method of identifying a place or point.

Just as you were taught in geometry that there are 360 degrees in a circle or a sphere, the earth also has 360
degrees, and they are measured using a grid pattern called the graticule. Lines of latitude and longitude allow any
absolute location on the earth to have an identifiable address of degrees north or south and east or west, which
allows geographers to accurately locate, measure, and study spatial activity.

Geographers and cartographers organize locations on the earth using a series of imaginary lines that encircle the
globe. The two primary lines are the equator and the prime meridian. From these lines, the systems of longitude
and latitude are formed, allowing you to locate yourself anywhere on the planet. The line is the longest when you
travel along in an east-west direction. At the equator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two equinoxes,
which occur in March and September.
