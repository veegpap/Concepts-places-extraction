The equator is the largest circle of latitude on Earth. The equator divides the earth into the Northern and Southern
Hemispheres and is called 0 degrees latitude. The other lines of latitude are numbered from 0 to 90 degrees going
toward each of the poles. The lines north of the equator toward the North Pole are north latitude, and each of the
numbers is followed by the letter “N.” The lines south of the equator toward the South Pole are south latitude,
and each of the numbers is followed by the letter “S.” The equator (0 latitude) is the only line of latitude without
any letter following the number. Notice that all lines of latitude are parallel to the equator (they are often called
parallels) and that the North Pole equals 90 degrees N and the South Pole equals 90 degrees S. Noted parallels
include both the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, which are 23.5 degrees from the equator. At 66.5
degrees from the equator are the Arctic Circle and the Antarctic Circle near the North and South Pole, respectively.
